      <p>One of my favorite things in life is my
        <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boxer/" target="_blank">dog</a>.
        He never fails to brighten my day, regardless of how I'm feeling. I can unwind and temporarily forget about my worries when I sit with him or take him for walks.
        <span class="highlight">He seems to understand me without using words</span>, and I adore how devoted and content he is.
        His presence reminds me to be patient, kind, and present while appreciating the small things in life.

      <h3>The Beach</h3>

      <p>I've always found that going to the beach helps me recharge. I feel at ease and liberated when I hear the waves and feel the sand beneath my feet. I enjoy spending the day there with friends, swimming in the
        <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/lifeguards/beaches" target="_blank">ocean</a> and watching the sunset.
        When I'm at the beach, I'm reminded of how vast the world is and how small my problems can seem in the presence of nature.

      <p>To me, my <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/family-kinship" target="_blank">family</a> is everything.
        They cheer me on at every turn and help me overcome every obstacle. Whether we’re dining together, traveling, or just talking, I always feel grounded with them.
        They’ve taught me the value of diligence, decency, and empathy. My family is my greatest source of inspiration and the reason I strive to be my best self.
