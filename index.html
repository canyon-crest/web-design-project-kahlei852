            He never fails to brighten my day. <span class="highlight">He seems to understand me without using words</span>, and I adore how devoted and content he is.

I also enjoy taking photos of him during our walks and sharing funny moments with friends. Having him around makes even ordinary days feel brighter, and I always look forward to the adventures we share together.
